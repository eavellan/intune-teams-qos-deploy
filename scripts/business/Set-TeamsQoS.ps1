.SYNOPSIS
    Applies Microsoft Teams DSCP (QoS) tagging for Audio, Video, Screen Sharing, and Signaling on Windows 10/11 Business editions.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script uses New-NetQosPolicy to configure DSCP markings on ms-teams.exe.
    It is intended for deployment via Intune Device Scripts to environments where OMA-URI is not supported (e.g., Windows 11 Business).
